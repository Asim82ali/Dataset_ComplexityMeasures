# Dataset_ComplexityMeasures
This code checks any dataset for its complexity measures before and after applying data resampling method using the problexity library
The repository contains two files. 
  First file calculates complexity measures before applying data resampling method
  Second file calculates complexity measures after applying data resampling method
There are two methods of data resampling SMOTE or ROS and for classification RF, KNN, MLP, and NB is used. Finally, for performance evaluation F1-score is used.
